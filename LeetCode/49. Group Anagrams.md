# 49. Group Anagrams

Given an array of strings `strs`, group the anagrams together. You can return the answer in **any order**.

An **Anagram** is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: strs = ["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"]
Output: [["bat"],["nat","tan"],["ate","eat","tea"]]
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: strs = [""]
Output: [[""]]
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: strs = ["a"]
Output: [["a"]]
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= strs.length <= 104`
* `0 <= strs[i].length <= 100`
* `strs[i]` consists of lowercase English letters.


## Solution

* Consider sorted anagram as a **prototype** or **blueprint** for all words(origin) contained the exact same character combination.
* Blueprint is key, all the original anagrams will be an element in the mapping list.

```python
class Solution:
    def groupAnagrams(self, strs: List[str]) -> List[List[str]]:
        """Hash Table, Sorting."""
        # Hash Table: {sorted string: [origin strings...] 
        blueprints = dict()
        for origin in strs:
            # blueprint added before, append to list of origins
            bp = "".join(sorted(origin))
            if bp in blueprints:
                blueprints[bp].append(origin)
            # create list for new blueprint and append current origin 
            else:
                blueprints[bp] = [origin]
        return [origin_ls for origin_ls in blueprints.values()]
```
