# 1171. Remove Zero Sum Consecutive Nodes from Linked List

Given the `head` of a linked list, we repeatedly delete consecutive sequences of nodes that sum to `0` until there are no such sequences.

After doing so, return the head of the final linked list.  You may return any such answer.

 

(Note that in the examples below, all sequences are serializations of ListNode objects.)

**Example 1:**

**Input:** `head = [1,2,-3,3,1]`
**Output:** `[3,1]`
**Note:** The answer `[1,2,1]` would also be accepted.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** `head = [1,2,3,-3,4]`
**Output:** `[1,2,4]`

**Example 3:**

**Input:** `head = [1,2,3,-3,-2]`
**Output:** `[1]`
 

**Constraints:**

* The given linked list will contain between `1` and `1000` nodes.
* Each node in the linked list has `-1000 <= node.val <= 1000`.



## Solution
```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def removeZeroSumSublists(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        """hash table, update same prefix sum"""
        # KEY: use dummy, the subarray could be the whole list
        dummy = ListNode(0, next=head)
        seen = dict()
        cur = dummy
        prefix_sum = 0
        # {current prefix_sum: related node}
        # KEY: if we reach the same prefix_sum, the related node will be updated to the latest one in the hash table
        while cur:
            prefix_sum += cur.val
            seen[prefix_sum] = cur
            cur = cur.next
        
        cur = dummy
        prefix_sum = 0
        while cur:
            prefix_sum += cur.val
            # for dummy -> 1 -> -1, prefix_sum has been updated to {0: node{-1}}
            cur.next = seen[prefix_sum].next
            cur = cur.next
        return dummy.next
```
