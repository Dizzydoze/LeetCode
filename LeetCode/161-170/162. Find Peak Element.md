# 162. Find Peak Element

A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.

Given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums`, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to **any of the peaks**.

You may imagine that `nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž`. In other words, an element is always considered to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside the array.

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(log n)` time.

 

**Example 1:**

>**Input:** `nums = [1,2,3,1]`  
**Output:** `2`  
**Explanation:** `3 is a peak element and your function should return the index number 2.`


**Example 2:**

>**Input:** `nums = [1,2,1,3,5,6,4]`  
**Output:** `5`  
**Explanation:** `Your function can return either index number 1 where the peak element is 2, or index number 5 where the peak element is 6.`
 

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= nums.length <= 1000`
* `-231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1`
* `nums[i] != nums[i + 1]` for all valid `i`.


## Binary Search + Two Pointers
```python
class Solution:
    def findPeakElement(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        """Binary Search + Two Pointers"""
        l, r = 0, len(nums) - 1
        while l < r:
            mid = l + (r-l) // 2
            # number found
            if nums[mid] > nums[mid-1] and nums[mid] > nums[mid+1]:
                return mid

            # assume everything on the LEFT is the OUTSIDE ...[mid] < [mid+1, len(nums)-1], RIGHT part must have a peak
            # mid is idx out of the array, which regard as any x < nums[mid+1]
            if nums[mid] < nums[mid + 1]:
                l = mid + 1
            # [0, mid] > [mid+1]... assume everything on the RIGHT is the OUTSIDE, LEFT part must have a peak
            # mid+1 is idx out of the arrary, which regard as any nums[mid] > x
            else:
                r = mid - 1
        # try [1,2,3,4], l keeps moving forward until reaches 4, l == r, l is the answer
        # try [5,2,1,3], r keeps moving backward until reaches 1, l ==r, l is the answer
        # so l will always be the answer if one of the pointer reaches the end
        return l
```
