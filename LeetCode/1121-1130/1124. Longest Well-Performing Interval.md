# 1124. Longest Well-Performing Interval


We are given `hours`, a list of the number of hours worked per day for a given employee.

A day is considered to be a `tiring day` if and only if the number of hours worked is (strictly) greater than `8`.

A `well-performing interval` is an interval of days for which the number of tiring days is strictly larger than the number of non-tiring days.

Return the length of the longest well-performing interval.

 

**Example 1:**

>**Input:** `hours = [9,9,6,0,6,6,9]`  
**Output:** `3`  
**Explanation:** `The longest well-performing interval is [9,9,6].`


**Example 2:**

> **Input:** `hours = [6,6,6]`  
**Output:** `0`
 

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= hours.length <= 104`
* `0 <= hours[i] <= 16`


## Solution
```python
class Solution:
    def longestWPI(self, hours: List[int]) -> int:
        """hash table + prefix sum counting"""
        # score  1, 2, 1, 0, -1, -2, -1
        # hours [9, 9, 6, 0,  6,  6,  9]
        # idx    0, 1, 2, 3,  4,  5,  6
        score = 0
        maxl = 0
        # {score: idx}
        d = dict()
        for i in range(len(hours)):
            # tiring +1, non-tiring -1
            score += 1 if hours[i] > 8 else -1
            # more tiring day, previous i+1 days are length of good interval
            if score > 0:
                # update max length
                maxl = max(maxl, i + 1)
            else:
                # KEY POINT
                # Either +1 or -1 can reach score on current idx
                # Find a point j = d[score - 1], no matter what happens between 
                # j and i, [j+1, i] contains one more tiring day which is a good interval
                # eg. i = 7, j = d[0 - 1] = d[-1] = 4, so [4+1, 7] is the good interval
                # score  1, 2, 1, 0, -1, -2, -1, 0, -1, 0
                # hours [9, 9, 6, 0,  6,  6,  9, 9,  6, 9]
                # idx    0, 1, 2, 3,  4,  5,  6, 7,  8, 9
                if score - 1 in d:
                    # i - d[score - 1] is the length of good interval
                    maxl = max(maxl, i - d[score - 1])
                # update current score with idx if it has not been added before
                d.setdefault(score, i)
        return maxl
