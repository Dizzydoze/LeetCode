# 486. Predict the Winner

ou are given an integer array `nums`. Two players are playing a game with this array: player 1 and player 2.

Player 1 and player 2 take turns, with player 1 starting first. Both players start the game with a score of `0`. At each turn, the player takes one of the numbers from either end of the array (i.e., `nums[0]` or `nums[nums.length - 1]`) which reduces the size of the array by `1`. The player adds the chosen number to their score. The game ends when there are no more elements in the array.

Return `true` if Player 1 can win the game. If the scores of both players are equal, then player 1 is still the winner, and you should also return `true`. You may assume that both players are playing optimally.


**Example 1:**

>**Input**: nums = [1,5,2]  
**Output**: false  
**Explanation**: Initially, player 1 can choose between 1 and 2.   
If he chooses 2 (or 1), then player 2 can choose from 1 (or 2) and 5. If player 2 chooses 5, then player 1 will be left with 1 (or 2).   
So, final score of player 1 is 1 + 2 = 3, and player 2 is 5.   
Hence, player 1 will never be the winner and you need to return false.  

**Example 2:**

>**Input**: nums = [1,5,233,7]   
**Output**: true  
**Explanation**: Player 1 first chooses 1. Then player 2 has to choose between 5 and 7. No matter which number player 2 choose, player 1 can choose 233.  
Finally, player 1 has more score (234) than player 2 (12), so you need to return True representing player1 can win.  
 

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= nums.length <= 20`
* `0 <= nums[i] <= 107`
