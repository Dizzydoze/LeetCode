# 506. Relative Ranks

You are given an integer array `score` of size `n`, where `score[i]` is the score of the `ith` athlete in a competition. All the scores are guaranteed to be unique.

The athletes are placed based on their scores, where the `1st` place athlete has the highest score, the `2nd` place athlete has the `2nd` highest score, and so on. The placement of each athlete determines their rank:

The `1st` place athlete's rank is `"Gold Medal"`.
The `2nd` place athlete's rank is `"Silver Medal"`.
The `3rd` place athlete's rank is `"Bronze Medal"`.
For the `4th` place to the nth place athlete, their rank is their placement number (i.e., the xth place athlete's rank is "x").
Return an array answer of size `n` where `answer[i]` is the rank of the ith athlete.

 

**Example 1:**

Input: score = [5,4,3,2,1]
Output: ["Gold Medal","Silver Medal","Bronze Medal","4","5"]
Explanation: The placements are [1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th].
**Example 2:**

Input: score = [10,3,8,9,4]
Output: ["Gold Medal","5","Bronze Medal","Silver Medal","4"]
Explanation: The placements are [1st, 5th, 3rd, 2nd, 4th].

 

**Constraints:**

* `n == score.length`
* `1 <= n <= 104`
* `0 <= score[i] <= 106`
* All the values in score are unique.


## Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def findRelativeRanks(self, score: List[int]) -> List[str]:
        # python built in heap is minHeap, pop to get smallest element
        res, heap = [None]*len(score), list()
        # push (-score, idx) in to minHeap, sorted reversely
        for idx, item in enumerate(score):
            heapq.heappush(heap, (-item, idx))
        # pop biggest element from minHeap and save result to origin idx
        rank = 1
        while heap:
            _, idx = heapq.heappop(heap)
            if rank == 1:
                res[idx] = "Gold Medal"
            elif rank == 2:
                res[idx] = "Silver Medal"
            elif rank == 3:
                res[idx] = "Bronze Medal"
            else:
                # the rest are just num of rank
                res[idx] = str(rank)
            rank += 1
        return res
