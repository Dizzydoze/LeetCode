# 669. Trim a Binary Search Tree

Given the `root` of a binary search tree and the lowest and highest boundaries as `low` and `high`, trim the tree so that all its elements lies in `[low, high]`. Trimming the tree should not change the relative structure of the elements that will remain in the tree (i.e., any node's descendant should remain a descendant). It can be proven that there is a **unique answer**.

Return *the root of the trimmed binary search tree.* Note that the root may change depending on the given bounds.

 

**Example 1:**

![img.png](../../Images/669-1.png)

>Input: root = [1,0,2], low = 1, high = 2  
Output: [1,null,2]  

**Example 2:**

![img_1.png](../../Images/669-2.png)

>Input: root = [3,0,4,null,2,null,null,1], low = 1, high = 3  
Output: [3,2,null,1]  
 

**Constraints:**

* The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 104]`.
* `0 <= Node.val <= 104`
* The value of each node in the tree is unique.
* root is guaranteed to be a valid binary search tree.
* `0 <= low <= high <= 104`

        if (root == null){
            return null;
        }
        // all left side < low, only check right; already out of bound, no reconnection for current node
        if (root.val < low){
            return trimBST(root.right, low, high);
        }
        // all right side > high, only check left; already out of bound, no reconnection for current node
        else if (root.val > high){
            return trimBST(root.left, low, high);
        }
        // within boundry, check both side, reconnect the trim result from both side
        else{
            root.left = trimBST(root.left, low, high);
