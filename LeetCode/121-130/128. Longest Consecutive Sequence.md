# 128. Longest Consecutive Sequence

Given an unsorted array of integers `nums`, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(n)` time.

 

**Example 1**:

>**Input**: nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]  
**Output**: 4  
**Explanation**: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.  


**Example 2**:

>**Input**: nums = [0,3,7,2,5,8,4,6,0,1]  
**Output**: 9  
 

**Constraints:**

* **0 <= nums.length <= 105**
* **-109 <= nums[i] <= 109**


```python
class Solution:
    def longestConsecutive(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        # Hash Map, O(N) linear time
        if not nums:
            return 0
        # skip duplicates, same for consecutive sequence
        num_set = set(nums) 
        
        # KEY: num - 1 not in the set means its a NEW START of a subsequence
        mx_count = 0
        for num in num_set:
            if num - 1 not in num_set:
                cur = num
                count = 1
                # keep update cur and count until the sequence breaks
                while cur + 1 in num_set:
                    cur = cur + 1
                    count += 1
                mx_count = max(mx_count, count)
        return mx_count
```
