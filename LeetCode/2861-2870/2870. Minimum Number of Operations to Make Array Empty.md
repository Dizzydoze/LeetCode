# 2870. Minimum Number of Operations to Make Array Empty

You are given a **0-indexed** array nums consisting of positive integers.

There are two types of operations that you can apply on the array **any** number of times:

* Choose **two** elements with equal values and **delete** them from the array.
* Choose **three** elements with equal values and **delete** them from the array.
Return *the **minimum** number of operations required to make the array empty, or `-1` if it is not possible.*


**Example 1:**

>**Input**: nums = [2,3,3,2,2,4,2,3,4]  
**Output**: 4  
**Explanation**: We can apply the following operations to make the array empty:  
>- Apply the first operation on the elements at indices 0 and 3. The resulting array is nums = [3,3,2,4,2,3,4].  
>- Apply the first operation on the elements at indices 2 and 4. The resulting array is nums = [3,3,4,3,4].  
>- Apply the second operation on the elements at indices 0, 1, and 3. The resulting array is nums = [4,4].  
>- Apply the first operation on the elements at indices 0 and 1. The resulting array is nums = [].  
>It can be shown that we cannot make the array empty in less than 4 operations.  

**Example 2:**

>**Input**: nums = [2,1,2,2,3,3]  
**Output**: -1  
**Explanation**: It is impossible to empty the array.  
 

**Constraints:**

* `2 <= nums.length <= 105`
* `1 <= nums[i] <= 106`


## Math(Counting) + Hash Table + Greedy

```python
class Solution:
    def minOperations(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        # hash table + counting + greedy
        # %3 == 0, steps = cnt // 3
        # %3 == 1, steps = (cnt - 2*2) // 3 + 2
        # %3 == 2, steps = (cnt - 2*1) // 3 + 1
        # Greedy, KEY: the smallest operation == ceiling n/3
        # 2/3 -> 1
        # 4/3 -> 2
        # 5/3 -> 2
        # KEY: ceiling n/3 == floor n+2/3

        cnt = collections.Counter(nums)
        # edge case, no operation can delete single element
        if 1 in cnt.values():
            return -1
        return sum((count + 2) // 3 for count in cnt.values())
```
