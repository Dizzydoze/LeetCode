# 286. Walls and Gates


You are given an `m x n` grid `rooms` initialized with these three possible values.

* `-1` A wall or an obstacle.
* `0` A gate.
* `INF` Infinity means an empty room. We use the value `2^31 - 1 = 2147483647` to represent `INF` as you may assume that the distance to a gate is less than `2147483647`.
Fill each empty room with the distance to its nearest gate. If it is impossible to reach a gate, it should be filled with INF.

  
**Example 1:**

>**Input**: rooms = [[2147483647,-1,0,2147483647],[2147483647,2147483647,2147483647,-1],[2147483647,-1,2147483647,-1],[0,-1,2147483647,2147483647]]  
**Output**: [[3,-1,0,1],[2,2,1,-1],[1,-1,2,-1],[0,-1,3,4]]  


**Example 2:**

>**Input**: rooms = [[-1]]  
**Output**: [[-1]]  
 

**Constraints:**

* `m == rooms.length`
* `n == rooms[i].length`
* `1 <= m, n <= 250`
* `rooms[i][j]` is `-1`, `0`, or `2^31 - 1`.
