# 287. Find the Duplicate Number

Given an array of integers `nums` containing `n + 1` integers where each integer is in the range `[1, n]` inclusive.

There is only **one repeated** number in `nums`, return *this repeated number*.

You must solve the problem **without** modifying the array `nums` and uses only constant extra space.

 

**Example 1:**

>**Input:** `nums = [1,3,4,2,2]`  
**Output:** `2`


**Example 2:**

>**Input:** `nums = [3,1,3,4,2]`  
**Output:** `3`
 

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= n <= 105`
* `nums.length == n + 1`
* `1 <= nums[i] <= n`
* All the integers in `nums` appear only **once** except for **precisely one integer** which appears **two or more** times.
 

Follow up:

How can we prove that at least one duplicate number must exist in nums?
Can you solve the problem in linear runtime complexity?

## Solution
```python

    def findDuplicate(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        """
        Floyd's Cycle Detection
        Linked List + Fask&Slow Pointers
        
        n+1 slots, number range [1, n]
        so there has to be one number duplicates
        
    
        index: the node itself
        arr[index]: the next pointer point to the next node 
    
        node      0         1         2         3         4           
        node.next n.next=1  n.next=3  n.next=4  n.next=2  n.next=2
        0 -> 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 4
                       \ <- /    
    
        slow&fast pointer intersect somewhere inside the loop
        a is length before the start node of the cycle(0 -> 2)
        b is length between start node of the cycle and slow&fast intersection point(somewhere in the cycle) 
        c is length from intersection point to start node of the cycle
        L is the length of cycle
        L = b + c
        we define 2slow = fast
        before intersection
        slow went through = a + b
        fast = 2slow = 2(a + b)
        we know fast has to go k more round than slow until they meet each other
        fast = a + b + kL
        algebra: 2(a+b) = a + b + kL
        a = kL - b = (k-1)L + (L-b) = (k-1)L + c
    
        conclusion:
        slow goes at start point for "a" step
        fast goes at intersection point for k-1 cycle and goes "c" more step to meet slow
    
        it DOES NOT MATTER what is c, the equation proves
        after intersection, with the same speed,
        slow pointer goes from start point
        fast pointer goes from intersection point
        they will finally meet after fast goes for k-1 cycle and c steps
