# 1004. Max Consecutive Ones III



Given a binary array `nums` and an integer `k`, return the maximum number of consecutive `1`'s in the array if you can flip at most `k` `0`'s.


**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0], k = 2
Output: 6
Explanation: [1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1]
Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1. The longest subarray is underlined.
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1], k = 3
Output: 10
Explanation: [0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1]
Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1. The longest subarray is underlined.
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= nums.length <= 105`
* `nums[i] is either 0 or 1.`
* `0 <= k <= nums.length`


## Solution
```python
class Solution:
    def longestOnes(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        l = r = 0                      # both edge of window start from 0
        for r in range(len(nums)):     # move right pointer to expand window
            if nums[r] == 0:           # flip 0 and decrement k
                k -= 1  
            if k < 0:                  # we need to dump an 1 on the left to compensate
                if nums[l] == 0:       # if the 1 we give up is an 0, increment k back
                    k += 1      
                l += 1                 # move l forward to dump the 1 on the left
        # length between l and r must be the largest window
        return r - l + 1
```
