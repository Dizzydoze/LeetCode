# 62. Unique Paths

There is a robot on an `m x n` grid. The robot is initially located at the **top-left corner** (i.e., `grid[0][0]`). The robot tries to move to the **bottom-right corner** (i.e., `grid[m - 1][n - 1]`). The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time.

Given the two integers `m` and `n`, return *the number of possible unique paths that the robot can take to reach the bottom-right corner*.

The test cases are generated so that the answer will be less than or equal to `2 * 10^9`.


**Example 1:**

>**Input**: m = 3, n = 7  
**Output**: 28  


**Example 2:**

>**Input**: m = 3, n = 2  
**Output**: 3  
**Explanation**: From the top-left corner, there are a total of 3 ways to reach the bottom-right corner:  
1. Right -> Down -> Down  
2. Down -> Down -> Right  
3. Down -> Right -> Down  
 

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= m, n <= 100`


## 2D-DP-Top Down: Recursion + Memoization(2D Array)

1. **States**:
   * grid[row][col] stores the possible unique paths to reach this point

2. **Recursion Relation**:
    * current point unique paths = sum of possible previous points unique paths
    * only down, right two possible directions
    * grid[row][col] = grid[row][col-1] + grid[row-1][col]

3. **Base Case**:
    * grid[0][0] = 1 only one way for the start point


```python
class Solution:
    def uniquePaths(self, m: int, n: int) -> int:

        grid = [[-1] * n for _ in range(m)]
        # base case
        grid[0][0] = 1

        def dp(row, col):
            if row < 0 or row > m - 1 or col < 0 or col > n - 1:
                return 0
            if grid[row][col] == -1:
                grid[row][col] = dp(row, col-1) + dp(row-1, col)
            return grid[row][col]
        
        dp(m-1, n-1)
        return grid[m-1][n-1]
```


## 2D-DP-Bottom Up: Iteration + 2D Array
```python
class Solution:
    def uniquePaths(self, m: int, n: int) -> int:
        # extra row and col for convenience
        dp = [[0] * (n+1) for _ in range(m+1)]
        # Base Cases
        # extra 0   0   0   0 ... n
        #   1 start   
        #   0
        #   0
        #   0
        #  ...
        #   m                  dp[m][n]
        dp[1][0] = 1

        # row: from 1 to m
        # col: from 1 to n
        for row in range(1, m+1):
            for col in range(1, n+1):
                dp[row][col] = dp[row][col-1] + dp[row-1][col]

        return dp[m][n]
```
