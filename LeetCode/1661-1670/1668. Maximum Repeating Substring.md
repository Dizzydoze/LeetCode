# 1668. Maximum Repeating Substring

For a string `sequence`, a string `word` is `k`-**repeating** if `word` concatenated `k` times is a substring of `sequence`. The `word`'s **maximum** `k`-**repeating** **value** is the highest value `k` where `word` is `k`-repeating in `sequence`. If `word` is not a substring of `sequence`, `word`'s maximum `k`-repeating value is `0`.

Given strings `sequence` and `word`, return *the **maximum** `k`-**repeating** **value** of `word` in `sequence`*.

 

**Example 1:**

>**Input:** `sequence = "ababc", word = "ab"`  
**Output:** `2`  
**Explanation:** `"abab" is a substring in "ababc". ` 


**Example 2:**

>**Input:** `sequence = "ababc", word = "ba"`  
**Output:** `1`  
**Explanation:** `"ba" is a substring in "ababc". "baba" is not a substring in "ababc".`


**Example 3:**

>**Input:** `sequence = "ababc", word = "ac"`  
**Output:** `0`  
**Explanation:** `"ac" is not a substring in "ababc". `
 

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= sequence.length <= 100`
* `1 <= word.length <= 100`
* `sequence` and `word` contains only lowercase English letters.


## Find
```python
class Solution:
    def maxRepeating(self, sequence: str, word: str) -> int:
        """use "in" to find"""
        max_ = 0
        for i in range(1, len(sequence) + 1):
            if (word * i) in sequence:
                max_ = max(max_, i)
        return max_
```

## DP
```python
class Solution:
    def maxRepeating(self, sequence: str, word: str) -> int:
        """DP f[i] = f[i-m] + 1"""
        lseq, lword = len(sequence), len(word)
        # store previous repetition results
        # lseq + lword to avoid index error, ensure enough space
        dp = [0] * (lseq + lword)
        for i in range(1, lseq + 1):
            # length of current sequence must >= len of word
            if i - lword < 0:
                continue
            # sub sequence match word, one repetition found
            if sequence[i - lword: i] == word:
                # eg. seq = "a", word = "a"
                # dp[1] = dp[1-1] + 1, but dp[1] is out of range
                # to avoid this, make dp longer than length seq
                # add to storage for later accumulation addition
                dp[i] = dp[i-lword] + 1
        return max(dp)
```
