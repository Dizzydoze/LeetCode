# 200. Number of Islands

Given an `m x n` 2D binary grid `grid` which represents a map of `'1'`s (land) and `'0'`s (water), return *the number of islands*.

An island is surrounded by water and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume all four edges of the grid are all surrounded by water.

**Example 1:**

>**Input**: grid = [  
  ["1","1","1","1","0"],  
  ["1","1","0","1","0"],  
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],  
  ["0","0","0","0","0"]  
]  
**Output**: 1  


**Example 2:**

>**Input**: grid = [  
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],  
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],  
  ["0","0","1","0","0"],  
  ["0","0","0","1","1"]  
]  
**Output**: 3  
 

**Constraints:**

* `m == grid.length`
* `n == grid[i].length`
* `1 <= m, n <= 300`
* `grid[i][j]` is `'0'` or `'1'`.

## BFS

Similar to level traversal in Binary Tree.

1. start from points satisfied condition(add point=="1" into deque)(popleft to start), mark it as visited.
2. move 4 directions to the next points, add them into deque if condition satisfied, mark them as visited.
3. keep popping until deque empty, round ended, update answer(count).
4. next round

```python
class Solution:
    def numIslands(self, grid: List[List[str]]) -> int:
        # BFS
        # each 1 moves to 4 directions
        # turn visited point into 0
        DIRECTIONS = [(1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)]
        nrows, ncols = len(grid), len(grid[0])
        cnt = 0
        # O(M*N)
        for row in range(nrows):
            for col in range(ncols):
                # start to spread on this land, stop when it's 0(visited or sea)
                if grid[row][col] == "1":
                    # KEY: new island found, mark it as visited, avoid dead loop
                    grid[row][col] = "0"
                    dq = collections.deque([(row, col),])
                    # New Round: everytime we start the spreading of land, one island counted
                    cnt += 1
                    while dq:
                        cur_row, cur_col = dq.popleft()
                        # move from point to 4 directions
                        for x, y in DIRECTIONS:
                            r = cur_row + x
                            c = cur_col + y
                            # the next point is still land, store into queue for next round
                            # KEY: row and col should always be in boundary
                            if 0 <= r < nrows and 0 <= c < ncols and grid[r][c] == "1":
                                dq.append((r,c))
                                # KEY!: mark current point as visited ASAP
                                # the new popped point next round might revisited same point
                                grid[r][c] = "0"
        return cnt
```


## DFS

Similar to DFS in Binary Tree.
1. find points satisfy condition.
2. move 4 directions to next point using dfs.
3. if condition does not match or row||col out of boundary, end dfs
4. every time a dfs ends, result updated(count += 1)

```python
class Solution:
    def numIslands(self, grid: List[List[str]]) -> int:
        # DFS
        nrows, ncols = len(grid), len(grid[0])
        cnt = 0

        def dfs(row, col):
            # make sure current point is valid island
            if not valid_island(row, col):
                return
            
            # KEY: mark current point as visited, avoid dead loop
            grid[row][col] = "2"

            # move to next point
            dfs(row + 1, col)   # down
            dfs(row - 1, col)   # up
            dfs(row, col + 1)   # right
            dfs(row, col - 1)   # left
            
        def valid_island(row, col):
            # KEY: if grid[row][col] != "1", it's either sea or visited land
            return 0 <= row < nrows and 0 <= col < ncols and grid[row][col] == "1"
        
        # start to traverse and count islands
        for row in range(nrows):
            for col in range(ncols):
                # island found, start to spread by dfs
                if grid[row][col] == "1":
                    dfs(row, col)
                    # KEY: dfs ends, cnt +1 for current island
                    cnt += 1
        return cnt
```
