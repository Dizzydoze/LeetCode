# 198. House Robber

You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security systems connected and **it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night**.

Given an integer array `nums` representing the amount of money of each house, return *the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight **without alerting the police***.


**Example 1:**

>**Input**: nums = [1,2,3,1]  
**Output**: 4  
**Explanation**: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).  
Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.


**Example 2:**

>**Input**: nums = [2,7,9,3,1]  
**Output**: 12  
**Explanation**: Rob house 1 (money = 2), rob house 3 (money = 9) and rob house 5 (money = 1).  
Total amount you can rob = 2 + 9 + 1 = 12.
 

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= nums.length <= 100`
* `0 <= nums[i] <= 400`


## DP-Top Down: Recursion + Memoization

1. **STATE**: the house index we're at 
2. **RECURSION RELATION**: 
   1. don't rob: dp(i) = dp(i-1), amount remain the same
   2. rob: dp(i) = max(dp(i-1), dp(i-2) + nums[i])
      if we rob i, we must not rob i-1, so amount start from i-2
3. **BASE CASE**:
   * only 1 house: dp(0) = nums[0] we rob it 
   * only 2 house: dp(1) = max(nums[0], nums[1]), rob the richer one

```python
class Solution:
    def rob(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:

        memo = {}

        def dp(idx):
            if idx == 0:
                return nums[0]
            if idx == 1:
                return max(nums[0], nums[1])
            if idx not in memo:
                memo[idx] = max(dp(idx-1), dp(idx-2) + nums[idx])
            return memo[idx]
        
        return dp(len(nums) - 1)
```



## DP-Bottom Up: Iteration + Array

Much Faster without recursion

```python
class Solution:
    def rob(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        
        if n <= 1:
            return nums[0]
        dp = [0] * n
        
        # Base Cases
        dp[0], dp[1] = nums[0], max(nums[0], nums[1])
        
        # Don't rob: amount remain the same, dp[i-1]
        # Rob: meaning i-1 is not robbed, amount is dp[i-2] + nums[i]
        for i in range(2, n):
            dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], dp[i-2] + nums[i])
        return dp[-1]
        
```
