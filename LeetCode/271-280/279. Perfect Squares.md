# 279. Perfect Squares

Given an integer `n`, return *the least number of perfect square numbers that sum to `n`*.

A **perfect square** is an integer that is the square of an integer; in other words, it is the product of some integer with itself. For example, `1`, `4`, `9`, and `16` are perfect squares while `3` and `11` are not.


**Example 1:**

>**Input**: n = 12  
**Output**: 3  
**Explanation**: 12 = 4 + 4 + 4.  


**Example 2:**

>**Input**: n = 13  
**Output**: 2  
**Explanation**: 13 = 4 + 9.  
 

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= n <= 104`

```python
class Solution:
    def numSquares(self, n: int) -> int:
        # BFS + Deque
        # KEY: deduct square nums until the first time we reach 0
        
        # all the square nums with range n
        # 9**0.5 = 3, square nums will be [0, 1, 2, 3]
        squares = [i*i for i in range(int(n**0.5)+1)]
        # dq stores number to be deducted by square nums
        dq = collections.deque([n])
        # each level is one square num
        level = 0
        # avoid duplicate calculation
        visited = set()
        
        while dq:
            for _ in range(len(dq)):
                cur = dq.popleft()
                # reach the end of the path
                if cur == 0:
                    return level
                
                # try each of the square nums
                for sq in squares:
                    remain = cur - sq
                    if remain >= 0 and remain not in visited:
                        visited.add(remain)
                        # save it to queue for next round deduction
                        dq.append(remain)
            # all numbers in current level has been processed, level +1
            level += 1
        # one level for one square num, reach the end when it comes to 0
        return level
```
