# 2487. Remove Nodes From Linked List

You are given the `head` of a linked list.

Remove every node which has a node with a greater value anywhere to the right side of it.

Return *the `head` of the modified linked list*.


**Example 1:**

![img.png](../../Images/2487-1.png)

>**Input:** `head = [5,2,13,3,8]`  
**Output:** `[13,8]`  
**Explanation:** `The nodes that should be removed are 5, 2 and 3.`  
    - Node 13 is to the right of node 5.  
    - Node 13 is to the right of node 2.  
    - Node 8 is to the right of node 3.  


**Example 2:**

**Input:** `head = [1,1,1,1]`  
**Output:** `[1,1,1,1]`  
**Explanation:** `Every node has value 1, so no nodes are removed.`
 

**Constraints:**

* The number of the nodes in the given list is in the range `[1, 105]`.
* `1 <= Node.val <= 105`

## Reverse Iteration LinkedList

1. reverse iteration
2. remove all smaller nodes
3. reverse back(same func)

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def removeNodes(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        """Two Times Reverse, Reverse->Remove->Reverse"""
        # reverse the list
        def reverse(head):
            prev = None
            cur = head
            while cur:
                nxt = cur.next
                cur.next = prev
                prev = cur
                cur = nxt
            return prev

        # start to remove after reverse
        cur = head = reverse(head)
        prev = None
        max_ = -1
        while cur:
            nxt = cur.next
            # bigger node found
            if cur.val >= max_:
                # update max for next comparison
                max_ = cur.val
                # skip
                if prev:
                    prev.next = cur
                    # KEY: disconnect current node, it might be the last biggest node
                    cur.next = None
                # it's the head
                else:
                    head.next = None
                # move prev to the new bigger node
                prev = cur
            # move cur to next
            cur = nxt
        # reverse again
        return reverse(head)
```

## Stack(Reverse Intuition)

1. Reverse: intuition should be STACK, LIFO.
2. reconnect and reverse during stack popping, one pass.


```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def removeNodes(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        # stack
        stack = []
        curr = head
        while curr:
            stack.append(curr)
            curr = curr.next

        # create a new list by the first node
        curr = stack.pop()
        max_val = curr.val
        new_head = ListNode(curr.val)
        # pop from stack: iterate reversely, skip smaller, connect bigger
        while stack:
            curr = stack.pop()
            # skip smaller
            if curr.val < max_val:
                continue
            # connect bigger, update max value
            else:
                curr.next = new_head
                new_head = curr
                max_val = curr.val
        return new_head
```
