# 1838. Frequency of the Most Frequent Element

The **frequency** of an element is the number of times it occurs in an array.

You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`. In one operation, you can choose an index of `nums` and increment the element at that index by `1`.

Return *the **maximum possible frequency** of an element after performing **at most** `k` operations*.


**Example 1:**

>**Input:** `nums = [1,2,4], k = 5`  
**Output:** `3`  
**Explanation:** `Increment the first element three times and the second element two times to make nums = [4,4,4].`  
4 has a frequency of 3.


**Example 2:**

>**Input:** `nums = [1,4,8,13], k = 5`    
**Output:** `2`    
**Explanation:** There are multiple optimal solutions:  
`- Increment the first element three times to make nums = [4,4,8,13]. 4 has a frequency of 2.`  
`- Increment the second element four times to make nums = [1,8,8,13]. 8 has a frequency of 2.`  
`- Increment the third element five times to make nums = [1,4,13,13]. 13 has a frequency of 2.`

- **Example 3:**

>**Input:** `nums = [3,9,6], k = 2`  
**Output:** `1`
 

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= nums.length <= 105`
* `1 <= nums[i] <= 105`
* `1 <= k <= 105`


## Sorting + Sliding Window

```python
class Solution:
    def maxFrequency(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        # Sorting + Sliding Window
        nums.sort()
        # original window length is 1
        l = r = 0
        # res for max repetition, total for sum of the window
        res = total = 0
        while r < len(nums):
            # add new number after window expansion
            total += nums[r]
            # r - l + 1  the number repetition of nums[r]
            # condition means k modification is not enough, window needs to be shorten
            while nums[r] * (r - l + 1) > total + k:
                total -= nums[l]
                l += 1
            # update res the max repetition
            res = max(res, r - l + 1)
            # keep expanding the window
            r += 1
        return res
```

## Prefix Sum + Binary Search
This is much better, try to relearn, understand and practice next time.
