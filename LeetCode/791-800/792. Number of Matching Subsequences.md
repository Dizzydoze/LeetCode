# 792. Number of Matching Subsequences

Given a string `s` and an array of strings `words`, return the number of words`[i]` that is a subsequence of `s`.

A **subsequence** of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

* For example, `"ace"` is a subsequence of `"abcde"`.
 

**Example 1:**

>**Input:** s = "abcde", words = ["a","bb","acd","ace"]  
**Output:** 3  
**Explanation:** There are three strings in words that are a subsequence of s: "a", "acd", "ace".


**Example 2:**

>**Input:** s = "dsahjpjauf", words = ["ahjpjau","ja","ahbwzgqnuk","tnmlanowax"]  
**Output:** 2
 

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= s.length <= 5 * 104`
* `1 <= words.length <= 5000`
* `1 <= words[i].length <= 50`
* `s` and `words[i]` consist of only lowercase English letters.


## Binary Search


```python
class Solution:
    def numMatchingSubseq(self, s: str, words: List[str]) -> int:
        # Binary Search + Hash Table
        def bisect_right(arr, target):
            l, r = 0, len(arr)
            while l < r:
                mid = (l+r) // 2
                if arr[mid] > target:
                    r = mid
                else:
                    l = mid + 1
            return l

        # {ch: idx} save position of each char into hash table
        # sorted by each character's positions to use binary search
        # eg. s="babb", pos['b'] = [0,2,3]
        pos = collections.defaultdict(list)
        for i, ch in enumerate(s):
            pos[ch].append(i)
        
        res = 0

        for word in words:
            # subseq longer, impossible to match
            if len(word) > len(s):
                continue
            # start to search first position of each char in word
            # eg. "abcde" "ace"
            # start -> -1, bs find first a after -1
            # a -> s[0], bs find first c after 0
            # c -> s[2], bs find first e after 2
            # e -> s[4], end, check i == len(word), res += 1
            # use i to iterate target word
            start, i = -1, 0
            while i < len(word):
                position_ls = pos[word[i]]
                # find first index after start in position list
                first = bisect_right(position_ls, start)

                if first == len(position_ls):
                    break
                # first index of char found in position list, update start
                else:
                    start = position_ls[first]
                i += 1

            if i == len(word):
                # all char found
                res += 1
