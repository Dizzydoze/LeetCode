## 509. Fibonacci Number

The **Fibonacci numbers**, commonly denoted `F(n)` form a sequence, called the **Fibonacci sequence**, such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from `0` and `1`. That is,

>F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1
F(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2), for n > 1.

Given `n`, calculate `F(n)`.

 

**Example 1:**

>**Input**: n = 2  
**Output**: 1  
**Explanation**: F(2) = F(1) + F(0) = 1 + 0 = 1.  


**Example 2:**

>**Input**: n = 3  
**Output**: 2  
**Explanation**: F(3) = F(2) + F(1) = 1 + 1 = 2.  


**Example 3:**

>**Input**: n = 4  
**Output**: 3  
**Explanation**: F(4) = F(3) + F(2) = 2 + 1 = 3.  
 

**Constraints:**

* `0 <= n <= 30`


## DP

```python
"""
dynamic programmin(also known as dynamic optimization)
is a method for solving a complex problem by breaking it down into a collection of simpler subproblems,
solving each of those subproblems just once, and storing their solutions
- ideally, suing a memory-based data structure.

class Solution:

## Recursion + Memoization

```python
"""
Memoization is an optimization technique used primarily to speed up computer programs 
by storing the results of expensive function calls 
and returning the cached result when the same inputs occur again.
"""

class Solution:
    # Recursion
    def __init__(self):
        self.cache = {}

    def fib(self, n: int) -> int:
        # return result immediately in the cache
        if n in self.cache:
            return self.cache[n]
        # Base Case: f(0) = 1, f(1) = 1
        if n <= 1: 
            return n
        # Recursive Relation: f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2), n > 1
        res = self.fib(n-1) + self.fib(n-2)
        # memoization: store result to avoid re-calculation
        self.cache[n] = res
        return res
