# 1013. Partition Array Into Three Parts With Equal Sum

Given an array of integers arr, return true if we can partition the array into three non-empty parts with equal sums.
Formally, we can partition the array if we can find indexes i + 1 < j with (arr[0] + arr[1] + ... + arr[i] == arr[i + 1] + arr[i + 2] + ... + arr[j - 1] == arr[j] + arr[j + 1] + ... + arr[arr.length - 1])

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: arr = [0,2,1,-6,6,-7,9,1,2,0,1]
Output: true
Explanation: 0 + 2 + 1 = -6 + 6 - 7 + 9 + 1 = 2 + 0 + 1
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: arr = [0,2,1,-6,6,7,9,-1,2,0,1]
Output: false
```
**Example 3:**
```
Input: arr = [3,3,6,5,-2,2,5,1,-9,4]
Output: true
Explanation: 3 + 3 = 6 = 5 - 2 + 2 + 5 + 1 - 9 + 4
```

**Constraints:**

* 3 <= arr.length <= 5 * 104
* -104 <= arr[i] <= 104

```python
class Solution:
    def canThreePartsEqualSum(self, arr: List[int]) -> bool:
        # it must be cut into 3 parts
        sum_ = sum(arr)
        if sum_ % 3 != 0:
            return False
        target = sum_ // 3
        # start from 0, find i, index for the first part, sum is called cur
        cur, i, n = 0, 0, len(arr)
        while i < n:
            cur += arr[i]
            # index for the first part found
            if cur == target:
                break
            i += 1
        # after the iteration, i still can't be found
        if cur != target:
            return False
        # start from i + 1, find j, index for the sec part, keep adding on the cur
        j = i + 1
        # make sure there's at least one element for the last part
        # j < n - 1, at least index n - 1 for the last part
        while j + 1< n:
            cur += arr[j]
            # each part is 1/3, j is found when we reach 2/3
            if cur == target * 2:
                return True
            j += 1
        # 2/3 is not found
        return False
            
```
