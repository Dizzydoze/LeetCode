# 159. Longest Substring with At Most Two Distinct Characters.md


Given a string `s`, return *the length of the longest **substring** that contains at most **two distinct characters***.

 

**Example 1:**

>**Input**: s = "eceba"  
**Output**: 3  
**Explanation**: The substring is "ece" which its length is 3.  


**Example 2:**

>**Input**: s = "ccaabbb"  
**Output**: 5  
**Explanation**: The substring is "aabbb" which its length is 5.  
 

**Constraints**:

* `1 <= s.length <= 105`
* `s` consists of English letters.


## Sliding Window

```python
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLongestSubstringTwoDistinct(self, s: str) -> int:
        # Sliding Window
        cnt = collections.defaultdict(int)
        left, right = 0, 0
        mx = 0
        while right < len(s):
            cnt[s[right]] += 1
            # adding char at right make it more than 2 distinct chars, shrink the Window
            if len(cnt) > 2:
                cnt[s[left]] -= 1
                # dump the leftmost char in the window
                if cnt[s[left]] <= 0:
                    cnt.pop(s[left])
                # move left forward, window shrinked
                left += 1
            mx = max(mx, right-left+1)
            # adding char at right stays 2 distinct chars, widen the Window
            right += 1
        return mx
```
