# 746. Min Cost Climbing Stairs


You are given an integer array `cost` where `cost[i]` is the cost of `i^th` step on a staircase. Once you pay the cost, you can either climb one or two steps.

You can either start from the step with index `0`, or the step with index `1`.

Return the *minimum cost to reach the top of the floor*.


**Example 1:**

>**Input:** cost = [10,15,20]  
**Output:** 15  
**Explanation:** You will start at index 1.  
>- Pay 15 and climb two steps to reach the top.  
The total cost is 15.  


**Example 2:**

>**Input:** cost = [1,100,1,1,1,100,1,1,100,1]
**Output:** 6
**Explanation:** You will start at index 0.  
>- Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 2.  
>- Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 4.  
>- Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 6.  
>- Pay 1 and climb one step to reach index 7.  
>- Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 9.  
>- Pay 1 and climb one step to reach the top.  
The total cost is 6.  
 

**Constraints:**

* `2 <= cost.length <= 1000`
* `0 <= cost[i] <= 999`

## DP-Top Down: Recursion + Memoization
1. **State**: (step)idx we are at
2. **Recrusion Relation**:
   * take one step to reach i: dp[i-1] + cost[i-1]
   * take two steps to reach i: dp[i-2] + cost[i-2] 
3. **Base Case**:
   * dp[0], dp[1] = 0, 0, start with no cost

```python
class Solution:
    def minCostClimbingStairs(self, cost: List[int]) -> int:
        # Top Down: Recursion + Memoization
        # stores the minimum cost to reach idx
        memo = {}
        def dp(idx):
            if idx <= 1:
                return 0
            # take one step or take two steps to reach current idx
            if idx not in memo:
                memo[idx] = min(dp(idx-1)+cost[idx-1], dp(idx-2)+cost[idx-2])
            return memo[idx]
        # to the top floor, one step further
        return dp(len(cost))
```


## DP-Bottom Up: Iteration + Array

```python
class Solution:
    def minCostClimbingStairs(self, cost: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(cost)
        # reach the top, 1 step further
        dp = [0] * (n + 1)
        for i in range(2, n + 1):
            one_step = dp[i-1] + cost[i-1]
            two_steps = dp[i-2] + cost[i-2]
            dp[i] = min(one_step, two_steps)
        return dp[-1]
```
