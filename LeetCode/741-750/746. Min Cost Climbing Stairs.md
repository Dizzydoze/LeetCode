# 746. Min Cost Climbing Stairs


You are given an integer array `cost` where `cost[i]` is the cost of `i^th` step on a staircase. Once you pay the cost, you can either climb one or two steps.

You can either start from the step with index `0`, or the step with index `1`.

Return the *minimum cost to reach the top of the floor*.

 

**Example 1:**

>**Input:** cost = [10,15,20]  
**Output:** 15  
**Explanation:** You will start at index 1.  
>- Pay 15 and climb two steps to reach the top.  
The total cost is 15.  


**Example 2:**

>**Input:** cost = [1,100,1,1,1,100,1,1,100,1]
**Output:** 6
**Explanation:** You will start at index 0.  
>- Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 2.  
>- Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 4.  
>- Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 6.  
>- Pay 1 and climb one step to reach index 7.  
>- Pay 1 and climb two steps to reach index 9.  
>- Pay 1 and climb one step to reach the top.  
The total cost is 6.  
 

**Constraints:**

* `2 <= cost.length <= 1000`
* `0 <= cost[i] <= 999`

## DP

```python
class Solution:
    def minCostClimbingStairs(self, cost: List[int]) -> int:
        # DP
        # dp[i] stores minimum cost to reach i step, i is the TOP for each round
        dp = [0] * (len(cost) + 1)
        # starts at index 2
        # recurrence relation: dp[i] = min(cost[i-2] + dp[i-2], cost[i-1] + dp[i-1])
        for i in range(2, len(cost) + 1):
            take_one_step = dp[i-1] + cost[i-1]
            take_two_steps = dp[i-2] + cost[i-2]
            dp[i] = min(take_one_step, take_two_steps)
        # final level is the TOP level, dp[top] is the minimum cost of reaching TOP
        return dp[-1]
```
