# 540. Single Element in a Sorted Array


You are given a sorted array consisting of only integers where every element appears exactly twice, except for one element which appears exactly once.

Return *the single element that appears only once*.

Your solution must run in `O(log n)` time and `O(1)` space.


**Example 1:**

>**Input:** nums = [1,1,2,3,3,4,4,8,8]  
**Output:** 2


**Example 2:**

>**Input:** nums = [3,3,7,7,10,11,11]  
**Output:** 10
 

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= nums.length <= 105`
* `0 <= nums[i] <= 105`


## Binary Search + Two Pointers

use odd even index to decide direction to go.

```python
class Solution:
    def singleNonDuplicate(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        # Two Pointers + Binary Search
        l, r = 0, len(nums) - 1
        while l < r:
            # avoid overflow
            mid = l + (r-l) // 2
            # first num of pairs on the left always start with even idx
            # so we always get the even index, compare to its RIGHT number
            # move mid to even index
            if mid % 2 != 0:
                mid -= 1
            # we are on the LEFT side, go RIGHT, skip one pair(2 steps)
            if nums[mid] == nums[mid+1]:
                l = mid + 2
            # [1,1,2,3,|3,4|,4,8,8]
            # if we are on the LEFT, mid on even idx should == mid + 1
            # first num of pairs on the RIGHT always start with ODD idx
            # so we are on the RIGHT side, got LEFT
            else:
                r = mid
        # left == right is the single num
        return nums[l]
```
