# 92. Reverse Linked List II

Given the `head` of a singly linked list and two integers `left` and `right` where `left <= right`, reverse the nodes of the list from position `left` to position `right`, and return the *reversed list*.

 

**Example 1:**
![img_11.png](../Images/img_11.png)

```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], left = 2, right = 4
Output: [1,4,3,2,5]
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: head = [5], left = 1, right = 1
Output: [5]
```

**Constraints:**

The number of nodes in the list is n.
1 <= n <= 500
-500 <= Node.val <= 500
1 <= left <= right <= n
 

**Follow up:** Could you do it in **one pass**?

        cur = prev.next
        # there are (right - left + 1) nodes needed to be reversed

            cur = cur.next

        while stack:
