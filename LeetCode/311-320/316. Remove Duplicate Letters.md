# 316. Remove Duplicate Letters

Given a string `s`, remove duplicate letters so that every letter appears once and only once. You must make sure your result is 
the smallest in **lexicographical** order among all possible results.

 

**Example 1:**

>**Input**: s = "bcabc"  
**Output**: "abc"  


**Example 2:**

>**Input**: s = "cbacdcbc"  
**Output**: "acdb"  
 

**Constraints:**

`1 <= s.length <= 104`
`s` consists of lowercase English letters.



## Greedy + Stack

```python
class Solution:
    def removeDuplicateLetters(self, s: str) -> str:
        # greedy + stack
        # last index of each character
        last_idx = {c: i for i, c in enumerate(s)}
        # if char was not pop out and removed, it should be staying where it is
        visited = set()
        # store result of the optimal string
        stack = list()

        for i in range(len(s)):
            # "first time" meet this char
            if s[i] not in visited:
                # 1. stack is not empty, directly added if stack is empty
                # 2. stack[-1] > c, see if we should remove lexico larger chars in the stack
                # 3. i < last_idx[stack[-1]], the char at top of stack will show up again later, remove it
                while stack and stack[-1] > s[i] and i < last_idx[stack[-1]]:
                    top = stack.pop()
                    # remove it from the stack for the next occurrence
                    visited.discard(top)
                # after removing all duplicate and larger char, add current char into result stack
                stack.append(s[i])
                visited.add(s[i])
        return "".join(stack)
```
