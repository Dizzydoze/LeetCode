# 740. Delete and Earn

You are given an integer array `nums`. You want to maximize the number of points you get by performing the following operation any number of times:

Pick any `nums[i]` and delete it to earn `nums[i]` points. Afterwards, you must delete every element equal to `nums[i] - 1` and **every** element equal to `nums[i] + 1`.
Return ***the maximum number of points** you can earn by applying the above operation some number of times*.


**Example 1:**

>**Input**: nums = [3,4,2]  
**Output**: 6  
**Explanation**: You can perform the following operations:  
- Delete 4 to earn 4 points. Consequently, 3 is also deleted. nums = [2].  
- Delete 2 to earn 2 points. nums = [].  
You earn a total of 6 points.

**Example 2**:

>**Input**: nums = [2,2,3,3,3,4]  
**Output**: 9  
**Explanation**: You can perform the following operations:  
- Delete a 3 to earn 3 points. All 2's and 4's are also deleted. nums = [3,3].  
- Delete a 3 again to earn 3 points. nums = [3].  
- Delete a 3 once more to earn 3 points. nums = [].  
You earn a total of 9 points.  
 

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= nums.length <= 2 * 104`
* `1 <= nums[i] <= 104`


## DP-Top Down: Recursion + Memoization

1. **State:**
   * store in hash table points = {cur num: max points from 0 to cur num}
   * the num we picked(house we gonna rob)
2. **Recursion Relation:** 
   * (rob)pick current num: we can't pick num-1, maxPoints(num) = maxPoints(num-2) + points[num]
   * (not rob)not pick current num: remain the same max points as num-1, maxPoints(num) = maxPoints(num-1)
   * the answer will be the bigger one between pick and not pick
3. **Base Cases:**
   * num == 0, max points is 0, return 0
   * num == 1, max points >= 0, return points[1]

```python
class Solution:
    def deleteAndEarn(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        # once we select any num, we select all of them, we can pre calculate the sum by multiplication
        points = collections.defaultdict(int)
        
        # top down, start from max num in the nums
        mx = -1
        
        for num in nums:
            points[num] += num
            mx = max(mx, num)
        
        # memoization
        memo = {}

        def max_points(num):
            # get max points from 0 to num
            if num == 0:
                return 0
            # sum of picking all 1s
            if num == 1:
                return points[1]
            if num not in memo:
                # recursion relation, max(rob, not rob)
                memo[num] = max(max_points(num-2) + points[num], max_points(num-1))
            return memo[num]
        
        return max_points(mx)
```

## DP-Bottom Up: Iteration + Array

```python
class Solution:
    def deleteAndEarn(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        points = collections.defaultdict(int)
        mx = -1
        # Precompute how many points we gain from taking an element
        for num in nums:
            points[num] += num
            mx = max(mx, num)
        
        # array stores max points from 0 to num
        # Base Cases: 
        # for num == 0, max points will always be 0
        # for num == 1, max points will be sum of 1s
        # only need to iterate till max number
        max_points = [0] * (mx + 1)
        max_points[1] = points[1]

        # from base case to max num, we need each of the num in the range
        for num in range(2, mx+1):
            # recursion relation, max(rob, not rob)
            max_points[num] = max(max_points[num-2] + points[num], max_points[num-1])
        print(max_points)
        return max_points[-1]
```
