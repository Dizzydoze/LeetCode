# 797. All Paths From Source to Target

Given a directed acyclic graph (**DAG**) of n nodes labeled from `0` to `n - 1`, find all possible paths from node `0` to node `n - 1` and return them in **any order**.

The graph is given as follows: `graph[i]` is a list of all nodes you can visit from node `i` (i.e., there is a directed edge from node `i` to node `graph[i][j]`).

 

**Example 1:**

>Input: graph = [[1,2],[3],[3],[]]  
Output: [[0,1,3],[0,2,3]]  
Explanation: There are two paths: 0 -> 1 -> 3 and 0 -> 2 -> 3.  


**Example 2:**

![img_1.png](../Images/797-2.png)

>Input: graph = [[4,3,1],[3,2,4],[3],[4],[]]  
Output: [[0,4],[0,3,4],[0,1,3,4],[0,1,2,3,4],[0,1,4]]  
 

**Constraints:**

* `n == graph.length`
* `2 <= n <= 15`
* `0 <= graph[i][j] < n`
* `graph[i][j] != i` (i.e., there will be no self-loops).
* All the elements of `graph[i]` are **unique**.
* The input graph is **guaranteed** to be a **DAG**.


```python
class Solution:
    def allPathsSourceTarget(self, graph: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
        # DFS: Recursive
        # KEY: get all possible paths, no need to check visited
        n = len(graph)
        res = []

        def dfs(curr, path, target):
            # base case: target found, save current path
            if curr == target:
                res.append(path)
                return
            
            # go through all connected nodes
            for nxt in graph[curr]:
                # path + curr is a new copy
                dfs(nxt, path + [nxt], target)
        
        dfs(0, [0], n - 1)
        return res
```
