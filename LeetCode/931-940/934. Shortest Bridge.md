# 934. Shortest Bridge

You are given an `n x n` binary matrix `grid` where `1` represents land and `0` represents water.

An **island** is a 4-directionally connected group of `1`'s not connected to any other `1`'s. There are **exactly two islands** in grid.

You may change `0`'s to `1`'s to connect the two islands to form `one island`.

Return *the smallest number of `0`'s you must flip to connect the two islands.*

 

**Example 1:**

>Input: grid = [[0,1],[1,0]]  
Output: 1  

**Example 2:**

>Input: grid = [[0,1,0],[0,0,0],[0,0,1]]  
Output: 2  

**Example 3:**

>Input: grid = [[1,1,1,1,1],[1,0,0,0,1],[1,0,1,0,1],[1,0,0,0,1],[1,1,1,1,1]]  
Output: 1  
 

**Constraints:**

* `n == grid.length == grid[i].length`
* `2 <= n <= 100`
* `grid[i][j]` is either `0` or `1`.
* There are exactly two islands in `grid`.
