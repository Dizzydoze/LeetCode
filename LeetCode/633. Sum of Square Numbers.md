# 633. Sum of Square Numbers

Given a non-negative integer `c`, decide whether there're two integers `a` and `b` such that `a2 + b2 = c`.


**Example 1:**
```
Input: c = 5
Output: true
Explanation: 1 * 1 + 2 * 2 = 5
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: c = 3
Output: false
```

**Constraints:**

* `0 <= c <= 231 - 1`

## Solution
```python
class Solution:
    def judgeSquareSum(self, c: int) -> bool:
        """Maths, deduction, square root"""
        # deduction, a and b should not be bigger than square root of c
        # Example: sqrt(5) = 2.23606... int(sqrt(5)) = 2, a and b at most are 2
        for a in range(int(sqrt(c)) + 1):
            b = sqrt(c - a**2)
            # no need to round up
            if b == int(b):     
                return True
        return False
```
