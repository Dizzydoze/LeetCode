# 844. Backspace String Compare


Given two strings `s` and `t`, return `true` *if they are equal when both are typed into empty text editors*. `'#'` means a backspace character.

Note that after backspacing an empty text, the text will continue empty.


**Example 1:**

>**Input:** s = "ab#c", t = "ad#c"  
**Output:** true  
**Explanation:** Both s and t become "ac".  


**Example 2:**

>**Input:** s = "ab##", t = "c#d#"  
**Output:** true  
**Explanation:** Both s and t become "".


**Example 3:**

>**Input:** s = "a#c", t = "b"    
**Output:** false  
**Explanation:** s becomes "c" while t becomes "b".  
 

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= s.length, t.length <= 200`
* `s` and `t` only contain lowercase letters and `'#'` characters.
 

Follow up: Can you solve it in `O(n)` time and `O(1)` space?

## Stack

```python
class Solution:
    def backspaceCompare(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        def edit(string):
            stack = list()
            for ch in string:
                if ch == "#":
                    if stack:
                        stack.pop()
                else:
                    stack.append(ch)
            return stack
        return edit(s) == edit(t)
```


## Two Pointers
```python
class Solution:
    def backspaceCompare(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        # Two Pointers
        skipS, skipT = 0, 0
        i, j = len(s) - 1, len(t) - 1

        while i >= 0 or j >= 0:
            # Traverse BACKWARD to COUNT the "#" and SKIP deleted chars    
            while i >= 0:
                # Count the # 
                if s[i] == '#':
                    skipS += 1
                    i -= 1
                # We should skip current char
                elif skipS > 0:    
                    skipS -= 1
                    i -= 1
                # no more char to skip, stop and ready to compare
                else:
                    break
            # Both string will stop when current char can't be deleted
            while j >= 0:
                if t[j] == '#':
                    skipT += 1
                    j -= 1
                elif skipT > 0:
                    skipT -= 1
                    j -= 1
                else:
                    break
            
            # start to compare current char
            if i >= 0 and j >= 0:
                if s[i] != t[j]:
                    return False
            # one is ended and the other is not
            elif i>=0 or j >=0:
                return False
            # same char, or both come to the end
            i -= 1
            j -= 1
        return True
```
