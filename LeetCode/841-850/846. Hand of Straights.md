# 846. Hand of Straights

Alice has some number of cards and she wants to rearrange the cards into groups so that each group is of size `groupSize`, and consists of `groupSize` consecutive cards.

Given an integer array `hand` where `hand[i]` is the value written on the `i^th` card and an integer `groupSize`, return `true` if she can rearrange the cards, or `false` otherwise.

 

**Example 1:**

**Input:** `hand = [1,2,3,6,2,3,4,7,8], groupSize = 3`
**Output:** `true`
**Explanation:** `Alice's hand can be rearranged as [1,2,3],[2,3,4],[6,7,8]`


**Example 2:**

>**Input:** `hand = [1,2,3,4,5], groupSize = 4`  
**Output:** `false`  
**Explanation:** `Alice's hand can not be rearranged into groups of 4.`

 

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= hand.length <= 104`
* `0 <= hand[i] <= 109`
* `1 <= groupSize <= hand.length`


## Solution
```python
class Solution:
    def isNStraightHand(self, hand: List[int], groupSize: int) -> bool:
        """hash table + greedy"""
        # 1. must evenly divided by groupSize
        if len(hand) % groupSize != 0:
            return False
        # sort for traverse
        hand.sort()
        # count number of each card
        cnt = Counter(hand)
        # 2. gap must be 1, prev + 1 = next
        # start with min num x for each round
        for x in hand:
            # KEY: all cards of x might be used, we continue to next num
            if cnt[x] == 0:
                continue
            # start from n, gap == 1
            # use number from [x, x+groupSize-1] to form current group
            for num in range(x, x + groupSize):
                # no more card i for current group
                if cnt[num] == 0:
                    return False
                # card i USED, count -1
                cnt[num] -= 1
        return True
```
