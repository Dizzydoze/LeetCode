# 300. Longest Increasing Subsequence

Given an integer array `nums`, return *the length of the longest **strictly increasing subsequence**.*

 

**Example 1:**

>**Input:** `nums = [10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]`  
**Output:** `4`  
**Explanation:** `The longest increasing subsequence is [2,3,7,101], therefore the length is 4.`


**Example 2:**

>**Input:** `nums = [0,1,0,3,2,3]`  
**Output:** `4`


**Example 3:**

>**Input:** `nums = [7,7,7,7,7,7,7]`  
**Output:** `1`
 

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= nums.length <= 2500`
* `-104 <= nums[i] <= 104`
 

Follow up: Can you come up with an algorithm that runs in O(n log(n)) time complexity?
