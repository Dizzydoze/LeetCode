# 1200. Minimum Absolute Difference

Given an array of **distinct** integers `arr`, find all pairs of elements with the minimum absolute difference of any two elements.

Return a list of pairs in ascending order(with respect to pairs), each pair `[a, b]` follows

* `a, b` are from arr
* `a < b`
* `b - a` equals to the minimum absolute difference of any two elements in `arr`
 

**Example 1:**

>**Input**: arr = [4,2,1,3]  
**Output**: [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4]]  
**Explanation**: The minimum absolute difference is 1. List all pairs with difference equal to 1 in ascending order.  


**Example 2:**

>**Input**: arr = [1,3,6,10,15]  
**Output**: [[1,3]]  


**Example 3:**

>**Input**: arr = [3,8,-10,23,19,-4,-14,27]  
**Output**: [[-14,-10],[19,23],[23,27]]  
 

**Constraints:**

* `2 <= arr.length <= 105`
* `-106 <= arr[i] <= 106`


## Counting Sort

```python
class Solution:
    def minimumAbsDifference(self, arr: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
        # counting sort
        # update min difference during iteration
        def counting_sort(arr):
            """
            1. count occurrence
            2. overwrite with start index
            3. fill sorted list by start index
            """
            mx, mn = max(arr), min(arr)
            offset = -mn
            length = mx - mn + 1
            counts = [0] * length
            # no need to +1 as usual, duplicate pairs are the same
            for num in arr:
                counts[num + offset] = 1
            
            mini_diff = float('inf')
            prev = 0
            ans = []
            for cur in range(1, length):
                # no occurrence for this num, skip
                if counts[cur] == 0:
                    continue
                # possible smallest pair found, add to answer
                # current pair is [prev - offset, cur - offset]
                if cur - prev == mini_diff:
                    ans.append([prev - offset, cur - offset])
                
                # new mini_diff found, empty answer and update mini_diff
                elif cur - prev < mini_diff:
                    ans = [[prev-offset, cur-offset]]
                    mini_diff = cur - prev
            
                # update prev to cur to find the next pair
                prev = cur
