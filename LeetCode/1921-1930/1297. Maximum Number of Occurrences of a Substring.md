# 1297. Maximum Number of Occurrences of a Substring


Given a string `s`, return the maximum number of occurrences of **any** substring under the following rules:
* The number of unique characters in the substring must be less than or equal to `maxLetters`.
* The substring size must be between `minSize` and `maxSize` inclusive.
 

**Example 1:**

>**Input**: s = "aababcaab", maxLetters = 2, minSize = 3, maxSize = 4  
**Output**: 2  
**Explanation**: Substring "aab" has 2 occurrences in the original string.   
It satisfies the conditions, 2 unique letters and size 3 (between minSize and maxSize).


**Example 2:**

>**Input**: s = "aaaa", maxLetters = 1, minSize = 3, maxSize = 3  
**Output**: 2  
**Explanation**: Substring "aaa" occur 2 times in the string. It can overlap.  
 

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= s.length <= 105`
* `1 <= maxLetters <= 26`
* `1 <= minSize <= maxSize <= min(26, s.length)`
* `s` consists of only lowercase English letters.



## Sliding Window


```python
class Solution:
    def maxFreq(self, s: str, maxLetters: int, minSize: int, maxSize: int) -> int:
        # sliding window
        # KEY: longer substring repetition covers shorter substirng
        #      only consider minSize

        # hash table stores {substring: count of occurrence}
        occur = collections.defaultdict(int)

        n = len(s)
        # KEY: keep [i: i+windowSize] in boundry, minSize is the windowSize
        for i in range(n - minSize + 1):
            # get current substring with slice
            cur = s[i:i+minSize]
            # count the occurrence of chars in substring
            cnt = set(cur)
            # current substring is valid
            if len(cnt) <= maxLetters:
                # update current substring count in hash table
                occur[cur] += 1
        
        # edge case, substring shorter than the window size
        return max(occur.values()) if occur else 0
```
