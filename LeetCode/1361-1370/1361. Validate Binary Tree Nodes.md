# 1361. Validate Binary Tree Nodes


You have n binary tree nodes numbered from `0` to `n - 1` where node i has two children `leftChild[i]` and rightChild[i], return `true` if and only if **all** the given nodes form exactly one valid binary tree.

If node i has no left child then `leftChild[i]` will equal `-1`, similarly for the right child.

Note that the nodes have no values and that we only use the node numbers in this problem.


**Example 1:**

![img.png](../Images/1361-1.png)

>Input: n = 4, leftChild = [1,-1,3,-1], rightChild = [2,-1,-1,-1]  
Output: true  

**Example 2:**

![img.png](../Images/1361-2.png)

>Input: n = 4, leftChild = [1,-1,3,-1], rightChild = [2,3,-1,-1]  
Output: false  


**Example 3:**

![img.png](../Images/1361-3.png)

>Input: n = 2, leftChild = [1,0], rightChild = [-1,-1]  
Output: false  
 

**Constraints:**

* `n == leftChild.length == rightChild.length`
* `1 <= n <= 104`
* `-1 <= leftChild[i], rightChild[i] <= n - 1`

```java

    public boolean validateBinaryTreeNodes(int n, int[] leftChild, int[] rightChild) {
        // get root to start traversal
        int root = findRoot(n, leftChild, rightChild);
        if (root == -1){
            return false;
        }

        // RULE 2: No cycles in a tree, traverse each node, if node has been seen before, cycle exists
        HashSet<Integer> seen = new HashSet<>();
        seen.add(root);     // root is the first node we seen
        Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<>();
        stack.push(root);   // start from root

        while (!stack.isEmpty()){
            int node = stack.pop();
            // get children for current node
            int[] children = {leftChild[node], rightChild[node]};
 
            
            for (int child : children){
                // chlid not exist, continue
                if (child == -1){
                    continue;
                }

                }
                // add them into stack and seen for next round
                stack.push(child);
                seen.add(child);
            }
        }
        // RULE 3: All nodes must be reachable from root, so #traversal == #children
        return seen.size() == n;
    }

    private int findRoot(int n, int[] leftChild, int[] rightChild){
        // RULE 1: a tree must have exactly one root, find it as the beginning of traverse
        HashSet<Integer> children = new HashSet<>();
        
        for (int left: leftChild){
            children.add(left);
        }
        for (int right: rightChild){
            children.add(right);
        }
        // if node is found in children, it must has a parent, so it's not a root
        for (int node = 0; node < n; node++) {
            if (!children.contains(node)){
                return node;
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }
}
