# 1155. Number of Dice Rolls With Target Sum


You have `n` dice, and each dice has `k` faces numbered from `1` to `k`.

Given three integers `n`, `k`, and target, return *the number of possible ways (out of the `k^n` total ways) to roll the dice, so the sum of the face-up numbers equals `target`.* Since the answer may be too large, return it **modulo** `10^9 + 7`.

 

**Example 1:**

>Input: n = 1, k = 6, target = 3  
Output: 1  
Explanation: You throw one die with 6 faces.  
There is only one way to get a sum of 3.  

**Example 2:**

>Input: n = 2, k = 6, target = 7  
Output: 6  
Explanation: You throw two dice, each with 6 faces.  
There are 6 ways to get a sum of 7: 1+6, 2+5, 3+4, 4+3, 5+2, 6+1.  


**Example 3:**

>Input: n = 30, k = 30, target = 500  
Output: 222616187  
Explanation: The answer must be returned modulo 109 + 7.  
 

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= n, k <= 30`
* `1 <= target <= 1000`


## DP(Top Down) Recursion + Memoization
```python
class Solution:
    def __init__(self):
        self.MOD = 10**9 + 7
        # [dice][target] = ways

    def numRollsToTarget(self, n: int, k: int, target: int) -> int:
        
        memo = [[-1 for _ in range(target+1)] for _ in range(n+1)]

        def dp(dices, remain):
            # the last dice successfully achieved the last remain, so the remain is 0
            if dices == 0:
                return 1 if remain == 0 else 0
            # found previous result, return directly
            if memo[dices][remain] != -1:
                return memo[dices][remain]

            res = 0
            for roll in range(1, k+1):
                # KEY: ensure remain > roll, otherwise we will save 0 to negative index of memo
                if remain >= roll:
                    res += dp(dices - 1, remain - roll) % self.MOD
            # add current result for corresponding dice and remain
            memo[dices][remain] = res % self.MOD
            
            return memo[dices][remain] % self.MOD
         
        return dp(n, target)
```
