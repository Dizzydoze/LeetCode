# 692. Top K Frequent Words

Given an array of strings `words` and an integer `k`, return the `k` most frequent strings.

Return the answer sorted by the frequency from highest to lowest. Sort the words with the same frequency by their lexicographical order.

 

**Example 1:**
```
Input: words = ["i","love","leetcode","i","love","coding"], k = 2
Output: ["i","love"]
Explanation: "i" and "love" are the two most frequent words.
Note that "i" comes before "love" due to a lower alphabetical order.
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: words = ["the","day","is","sunny","the","the","the","sunny","is","is"], k = 4
Output: ["the","is","sunny","day"]
Explanation: "the", "is", "sunny" and "day" are the four most frequent words, with the number of occurrence being 4, 3, 2 and 1 respectively.
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= words.length <= 500`
* `1 <= words[i].length <= 10`
* `words[i]` consists of lowercase English letters.
* `k` is in the range `[1, The number of unique words[i]]`
 

**Follow-up**: Could you solve it in `O(n log(k))` time and `O(n)` extra space?


## Solution
```python
class Solution:
    def topKFrequent(self, words: List[str], k: int) -> List[str]:
        # built in Counter and sorting
        # store count, word into list
        l = [(cnt, w) for w, cnt in Counter(words).items()]
        # sorting based on -cnt, which ordered reversely
        # if the counts are the same, sorted based on word
        l.sort(key=lambda x:(-x[0], x[1]))
        # return top k frequent words
        return [w for cnt, w in l[:k]]
```
