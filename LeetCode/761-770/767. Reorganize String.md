# 767. Reorganize String


Given a string `s`, rearrange the characters of `s` so that any two adjacent characters are not the same.

Return *any possible rearrangement of `s` or return `""` if not possible.*


**Example 1:**

>**Input**: s = "aab"    
**Output**: "aba"  


**Example 2:**

>**Input**: s = "aaab"  
**Output**: ""
 

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= s.length <= 500`
* `s` consists of lowercase English letters.
